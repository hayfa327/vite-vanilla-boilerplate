Project Brief: Image Feed App 
Overview 
In this project, you will work in groups of four to create a web application that displays a 
collection of images fetched from an API. The goal is to apply your knowledge of HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript to build an interactive, data-driven interface. 
You will use vanilla JavaScript only — no frameworks or external libraries. How the 
application looks is completely up to your group, but you can take visual inspiration from 
platforms such as Instagram or Unsplash. 
Getting Started 
You will receive starter code in a repository containing basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
files to help you get started faster. Your group should fork or clone this repository to begin 
working on your project. 
Project Requirements 
1.  Fetch and display a collection of photos from the provided API. 
○  API documentation: https://image-feed-api.vercel.app/ 
○  The photos should be loaded dynamically with JavaScript (not written directly 
in the HTML). 
2.  Include (at least) one interactive element 
○  For example a button triggering something when the user clicks on it 
○  Ideas: “like” a photo, fetch more photos, toggle dark mode etc. 
3.  Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build your application. 
○  HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and data 
handling. 
○  No frameworks or external libraries are allowed. 
Bonus Features (Optional) 
If your core functionality works smoothly, consider adding one or more of the following: 
●  Display likes and comments (easier) 
○  Show the number of likes for each photo 
○  Display comments (if available) for each photo 
●  Loading states and error handling (medium difficulty) 
○  Show a loading indicator while data is being fetched 
○  Display user-friendly error messages if the API request fails 
●  Pagination (medium difficulty) 
○  Load more photos when the user clicks a button or scrolls down, instead of 
showing all at once 
●  Comment submission (more challenging) 
○  Add functionality to submit new comments for a photo 
Assessment 
Your project will be assessed based on the following course goals: 
S3 
●  Pass: You can build interactive, data-driven web interfaces using JavaScript to create 
responsive, user-focused experiences. 
●  Pass with Distinction: Your JavaScript implementation demonstrates a clear 
structure, effective interaction logic, and thoughtful design decisions that result in a 
responsive, user-focused experience. 
S4 
●  Pass: Collaborate on codebases using Git and GitHub to manage changes, maintain 
quality, and support shared development workflows. 
 
Your code must be available in a public repository on GitHub for assessment. Make sure all 
group members have contributed to the repository and that the commit history reflects your 
collaborative work.
